# Time Series Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on time series analysis and forecasting using various datasets including occupancy data and NVIDIA stock volatility data. The project implements different time series models and techniques to analyze and predict patterns in the data.

## Project Structure
- `train_occupancy.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and model implementation
- `Occupancy_train.csv`: Dataset containing occupancy training data

## Google Colab Link
You can access and run the project in Google Colab using the following link:
